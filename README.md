# index-herbariorum-indonesianum

This is a simple SQL personal project using data that I collected from the book _Index  Herbariorum Indonesianum_ by Indonesian Institute of Sciences (_Lembaga Ilmu Pendidikan Indonesia_/ LIPI).
The book provides list of herbarium managers from all over Indonesia with its little information such as address, collection, chief, etc.

Herbarium itself is a collection of preserved plants stored, catalogued, and arranged systematically for study.
